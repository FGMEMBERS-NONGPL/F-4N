CARRIER OPS:

See the FlightGear documents, or wiki, for information on how to start the simulation on a carrier.  When the simulation starts you should be in position at the catapult, with the parking brakes already set, engines running and flaps at full down.  First, set the launch bar by pressing the "l" (lower case L) key.  This will engage the launch bar (holdback) and illuminate a green light on your gear indicator panel.  Set your throttle to max and hit the "C" (shift-C) keys to launch.  Once airborne you can clean up by raising gear ("G" (lower case G) key), and raising flaps ("]" key).

To prepare to land, first check that your fuel load is not too high.  Now lower the hook ("n" (lower case N) key).  A green light on the instrument panel illuminates when the hook is down.  Configure with gear down ("shift-G") and full flaps ("]]").  Plan on a final approach speed of 130 knots, unless you are too heavy, in which case you need to add speed.  Line up with the angled deck and look for the white light on the "ball" for glidepath information.  Plan to touch down just prior to the first wire.  Raise the hook ("n" (lower case N) key) when you come to a stop.  If you miss the wires then apply full power and go around for another try.  Watch your fuel state!

REFUELING:

Click on the REFUEL switch, ARM position to arm the refueling system and extend the refueling probe.  Click on the REFUEL switch again, OFF position to disarm the refueling system and retract the probe.  Fuel onload is at 6000 pounds per minute (hard-coded in JSBSim).

FUEL DUMP:

Click on the DUMP switch to toggle the fuel dump system.  The system will not dump lower than a standpipe level of 4000 pounds.

THE MODEL:

The model is made by Alpha Simulations (http://www.alphasim.co.uk/) and was done in Microsoft's native format (MDL) for use with MSFS.  It was released by them as "freeware, non-commercial", so don't sell this model.  I converted it to AC3D format for use in FlightGear.  I added a 3D cockpit, spoilers for roll control (the F-4 used a combination of ailerons and spoilers), animated slats, and fixed AIM-7 Sparrows, refueling probe, lights, tanks, AIM-9's.

THE AI MODEL: 

Since the model is so texture heavy I've included a very low-poly (and untextured) model in the /Models/AI directory.
